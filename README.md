# Snake Game React App

This project is a proof of concept (POC) showcasing my hands-on experience with the fundamentals of CSS, JavaScript, React, and custom hooks. The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented using modern web technologies, demonstrating my ability to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.

## Live Demo

You can play the Snake Game live at [https://raj-kubal99.github.io/Snake-Game/](https://raj-kubal99.github.io/Snake-Game/).

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Navigate the snake using arrow keys and collect food to grow.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes.
- **Game Over Logic**: Implemented logic to handle collisions and restart the game.
- **Dynamic Scoring**: The score increases as the snake eats food.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for component-based architecture and state management.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language used to handle game logic and interactivity.
- **CSS**: For styling the game components and ensuring a visually appealing interface.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment process to host the application on GitHub Pages.
